## Description

README.md is an important document for any application as a guide that provides essential information on a project which includes the project title, sections on description, usage, installation, contribution, credits, license, badge, test, and questions. This application uses many tools, Node.js, npm, require, shields.io, and inquirer version 8.2.4, for collecting inputs from the responsive user, and then dynamically generates README.md files so that the students can be more devoted to working on the project.
